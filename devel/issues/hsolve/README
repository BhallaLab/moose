This directory contains a test case comparing NEURON simulation of a
neuron with results from MOOSE hsolve and ee solver.

h10.CNG.swc: Cell morphology from NeuroMorpho.org. Taken from
moose-examples/snippets.

h10.CNG.moose.py: Loads the swc file in MOOSE and sets the passive
properties. It records the Vm from the soma and the apical
compartments and dumps them to the outout file. Simulates with hsolve
if run with arguments, exponential Euler (EE) otherwise.

h10.CNG.hoc : Passive model of this cell for NEURON.

run_h10.CNG.hoc : Sets up current injection at the last apical section
of the above cell, simulates it and dumps the time, soma Vm and
stimulated compartment Vm.

compare_moose_nrn.py : Plots the dumped Vm from the three cases.
