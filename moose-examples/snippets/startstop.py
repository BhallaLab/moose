    This demo shows how to start, stop, and continue a simulation. 
    This is commonly done when we want to run a model till settling, then
    change a parameter or deliver a stimulus, and then continue the
    simulation.

    Here, the model is just the output of a PulseGen object which 
    generates periodic pulses.
    The demo shows how to start the simulation. using the 
    *moose.reinit* command to reset the model to its initial state,
    and *moose.start* command to run the model for the specified duration. 
    We issue multiple *moose.start* commands and do different things to
    the model between them. First, we change the delay of the pulseGen.
    Then we show a number of ways to assign the timestep (dt) to the
    table object in the simulation.
    Note that throughout this simulation the pulsegen is going at a 
    uniform rate, it is just being sampled by the output table at
    different intervals.

    # We change the table tick and use a different dt for it:
