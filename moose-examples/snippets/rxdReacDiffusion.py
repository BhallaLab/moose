'''
This example implements a reaction-diffusion like system which is
bistable and propagates losslessly. It is based on the NEURON example 
rxdrun.py, but incorporates more compartments and runs for a longer time.
The system is implemented as a hybrid of a reaction and a function which
sets its rates. Please see rxdFuncDiffusion.py for a variant that uses
just a function object to set up the system.
