    This is the Hello MOOSE program. It shows how to get MOOSE to do
    its most basic operations: to load, run, and graph a model defined 
    in an external model definition file.
    
    The loadModel function is the core of this example. It can accept
    a range of file and model types, including kkit, cspace and GENESIS .p
    files. It autodetects the file type and loads in the simulation.
    
    The wildcardFind function finds all objects matching the specified path,
    in this case Table objects hoding the simulation results. They were 
    all defined in the model file.
