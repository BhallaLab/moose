# This example illustrates how to set up a transport model with 
# four non-reacting molecules in a cylinder. 
# Molecule a and b have a positive motorConst so they are 
# are transported from soma (voxel 0) to the end of the cylinder.
# Molecules c and d have a negative motorConst so they are transported 
# from the end of the cylinder to the soma.
# Rate of all motors is 1e-6 microns/sec.
# Pools a and c start out with all molecules at the soma, b and d 
# start with all molecules at the end of the cylinder.
# Net effect is that only molecules a and d actually move. B and c
# stay put as their motors are pushing further toward their respective
# ends, and I assume all cells have sealed ends.
