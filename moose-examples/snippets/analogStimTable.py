    """
Example of using a StimulusTable as an analog signal source in
a reaction system. It could be used similarly to give other
analog inputs to a model, such as a current or voltage clamp signal.

This demo creates a StimulusTable and assigns it half a sine wave.
Then we assign the start time and period over which to emit the wave.
The output of the StimTable is sent to a pool **a**, which participates
in a trivial reaction::

    table ----> a <===> b

The output of **a** and **b** are recorded in a regular table
for plotting.
