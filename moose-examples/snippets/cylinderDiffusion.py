    This example illustrates how to set up a diffusion/transport model with
    a simple reaction-diffusion system in a tapering cylinder:

    | Molecule **a** diffuses with diffConst of 10e-12 m^2/s.
    | Molecule **b** diffuses with diffConst of 5e-12 m^2/s.
    | Molecule **b** also undergoes motor transport with a rate of 10e-6 m/s
    |   Thus it 'piles up' at the end of the cylinder.
    | Molecule **c** does not move: diffConst = 0.0
    | Molecule **d** does not move: diffConst = 10.0e-12 but it is buffered.
    |   Because it is buffered, it is treated as non-diffusing.

    All molecules other than **d** start out only in the leftmost (first)
    voxel, with a concentration of 1 mM. **d** is present throughout
    at 0.2 mM, except in the last voxel, where it is at 1.0 mM.

    The cylinder has a starting radius of 2 microns, and end radius of
    1 micron. So when the molecule undergoing motor transport gets to the
    narrower end, its concentration goes up.

    There is a little reaction in all compartments: ``b + d <===> c``

    As there is a high concentration of **d** in the last compartment,
    when the molecule **b** reaches the end of the cylinder, the reaction
    produces lots of **c**.

    Note that molecule **a** does not participate in this reaction.

    The concentrations of all molecules are displayed in an animation.
