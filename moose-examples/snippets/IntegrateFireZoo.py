Simulate current injection into various Integrate and Fire neurons.

All integrate and fire (IF) neurons are subclasses of compartment,
so they have all the fields of a passive compartment. Multicompartmental neurons can be created.
Even ion channels and synaptic channels can be added to them, say for sub-threshold behaviour.

The key addition is that they have a reset mechanism when the membrane potential Vm crosses a threshold.
On each reset, a spikeOut message is generated, and the membrane potential is reset to Vreset.
The threshold may be the spike generation threshold as for LIF and AdThreshIF,
or it may be the peak of the spike as for QIF, ExIF, AdExIF, and IzhIF.
The adaptive IFs have an extra adapting variable apart from membrane potential Vm.

Details of the IFs are given below.
The fields of the MOOSE objects are named exactly as the parameters in the equations below.

 LIF:      Leaky Integrate and Fire: 
           Rm*Cm * dVm/dt = -(Vm-Em) + Rm*I
           
 QIF:      Quadratic LIF: 
           Rm*Cm * dVm/dt = a0*(Vm-Em)*(Vm-vCritical) + Rm*I
           
 ExIF:     Exponential leaky integrate and fire: 
           Rm*Cm * dVm/dt = -(Vm-Em) + deltaThresh * exp((Vm-thresh)/deltaThresh) + Rm*I
           
 AdExIF:   Adaptive Exponential LIF: 
           Rm*Cm * dVm/dt = -(Vm-Em) + deltaThresh * exp((Vm-thresh)/deltaThresh) + Rm*I - w,
           
           tau_w * dw/dt = a0*(Vm-Em) - w,
           
           At each spike, w -> w + b0 "
           
 AdThreshIF: Adaptive threshold LIF:
           Rm*Cm * dVm/dt = -(Vm-Em) + Rm*I,
           
           tauThresh * d threshAdaptive / dt = a0*(Vm-Em) - threshAdaptive,
           
           At each spike, threshAdaptive is increased by threshJump  
           the spiking threshold adapts as thresh + threshAdaptive  
           
 IzhIF:    Izhikevich:
           d Vm /dt = a0 * Vm^2 + b0 * Vm + c0 - u + I/Cm,
           
           d u / dt = a * ( b * Vm - u ),
           
           At each spike, u -> u + d,
           
           By default, a0 = 0.04e6/V/s, b0 = 5e3/s, c0 = 140 V/s are set to SI units,
           so use SI consistently, or change a0, b0, c0 also if you wish to use other units.
           Rm from Compartment is not used here, vReset is same as c in the usual formalism.
           At rest, u0 = b V0, and V0 = ( -(-b0-b) +/- sqrt((b0-b)^2 - 4*a0*c0)) / (2*a0).
