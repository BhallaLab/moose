    """
This example describes the special (and discouraged) use case where
functions provide input to a reaction system. Here we have two functions of
time which control the pool # and pool rate of change, respectively::

number of molecules of a = 1 + sin(t)
rate of change of number of molecules of b = 10 * cos(t)

In the stochastic case one must set a special flag *useClockedUpdate*
in order to achieve clock-triggered updates from the functions. This is
needed because the functions do not have reaction events to trigger them,
and even if there were reaction events they might not be frequent enough to
track the periodic updates. The use of this flag slows down the calculations,
so try to use a table to control a pool instead.

To run in stochastic mode::

	''python funcInputToPools''

To run in deterministic mode::

	''python funcInputToPools false''
