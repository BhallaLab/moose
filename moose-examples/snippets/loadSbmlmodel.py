This example illustrates loading, running of an SBML model defined in XML format.
Default this  file load's 00001-sbml-l3v1.xml which is taken from l3v1 SBML testcase.
Plots are setup.
Model is run for 20sec.
As a general rule we created model under '/path/model' and plots under '/path/graphs'.
If someone wants to load anyother file then
