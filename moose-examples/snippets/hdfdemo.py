"""HDF5 is a self-describing file format for storing large

simulations data in HDF5 files."""

    """In this example 

    1. We create a passive neuronal compartment `comp`.

    2. We create an HDF5DataWriter object `hdfwriter` for writing to a
       file ``output_hdfdemo.h5``.  The `mode` of the HDF5DataWriter
       is set to `2` which means if a file of the same name exists, it
       will be overwritten.

    3. The membrane voltage `Vm` and membrane current `Im` of `comp`
       are connected to `hdfwriter` for recording.

    4. We set some attributes of the datasets and the file.

    5. We run the simulation, `hdfwriter` records and stores the `Vm`
       and `Im` values over time.

    6. We close the file by calling close() method of `hdfwriter`.

    Running this snippet creates the file ``output_hdfdemo.h5`` which
    reflects the structure of the model::
    
      model
        |
        |
        c[0]
        |
        |___im
        |
        |___vm
        

    `im` and `vm` are datasets containing `Im` and `Vm` field values
    recorded from `comp`.
