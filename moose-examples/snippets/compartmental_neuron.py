"""Setting up a compartmental neuron from scratch using MOOSE classes.

A simple electrophysiological simulation of a neuron composed of two
passive compartments. A current pulse is injected into the `soma`
compartment and the membrane voltage in both compartments are recorded
and saved into a csv file.

# Here we take a simple approach to try current injection experiemnt:
# Run the simulation for some time. Then set the `inject` field of the
# soma to a positive value and run for some more time. This will
# emulate a current injection for that duration. Finally, remove the
# current injection by setting the `inject` field back to 0 and run
# for some more time to get the discharging curve.

# Normally you should use a PulseGen object for this instead of
# stopping the simulation midway to set the inject field..
