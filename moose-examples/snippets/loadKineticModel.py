    This example illustrates loading, running, and saving a kinetic
    model defined in kkit format. It uses a default kkit model but
    you can specify another using the command line
	    ``python filename runtime solver``.
    We use the gsl solver here.
    The model already defines a couple of plots and sets the runtime 20 secs.
