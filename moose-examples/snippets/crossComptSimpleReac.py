    This example illustrates a simple cross compartment reaction::

        a <===> b <===> c

    Here each molecule is in a different compartment.
    The initial conditions are such that the end conc on all compartments
    should be 2.0.
    The time course depends on which compartment the Reac object is 
    embedded in.
    The cleanest thing numerically and also conceptually is to have both 
    reactions in the same compartment, in this case the middle one
    (**compt1**).
    The initial conditions have a lot of **B**. The equilibrium with 
    **C** is fast and so **C** shoots up and passes **B**, peaking at 
    about (2.5,9). This is also just 
    about the crossover point.
    **A** starts low and slowly climbs up to equilibrate.

    If we put **reac0** in **compt0** and **reac1** in **compt1**, 
    it behaves the same
    qualitiatively but now the peak is at around (1, 5.2)

    This configuration of reactions makes sense from the viewpoint of 
    having the
    reactions always in the compartment with the smaller volume, which is
    important if we need to have junctions where many small voxels talk to
    one big voxel in another compartment.

    Note that putting the reacs in other compartments doesn't work and in
    some combinations (e.g., **reac0** in **compt0** and **reac1** in 
    **compt2**) give
    numerical instability.
