    """
    This example illustrates how to run a model at different volumes.
    The key line is just to set the volume of the compartment::

        compt.volume = vol

    If everything
    else is set up correctly, then this change propagates through to all
    reactions molecules.

    For a deterministic reaction one would not see any change in output 
    concentrations.
    For a stochastic reaction illustrated here, one sees the level of 
    'noise' 
    changing, even though the concentrations are similar up to a point.
    This example creates a bistable model having two enzymes and a reaction.
    One of the enzymes is autocatalytic.
    This model is set up within the script rather than using an external 
    file.
    The model is set up to run using the GSSA (Gillespie Stocahstic systems
    algorithim) method in MOOSE.

    To run the example, run the script

        ``python scaleVolumes.py``

    and hit ``enter`` every cycle to see the outcome of stochastic
    calculations at ever smaller volumes, keeping concentrations the same.
