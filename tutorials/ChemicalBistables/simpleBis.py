# This example illustrates how to set up a kinetic solver and kinetic model
# using the scripting interface. Normally this would be done using the
# Shell::doLoadModel command, and normally would be coordinated by the
# SimManager as the base of the entire model.
# This example creates a bistable model having two enzymes and a reaction.
# One of the enzymes is autocatalytic.
# The model is set up to run using Exponential Euler integration.
# If you pass in the argument 'gssa' it will run with the stochastic
# solver.
# You may also find in interesting to change the volume.
