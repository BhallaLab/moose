CA1.morph.original.xml is the original file exported from neuroConstruct.
It does not work with MOOSE as it has inhomogeneous_value tags,
 and negative conductances for hd channel (!),
 and channels whose parameters change in the morphml after loading in the channelml.

CA1.morph.bad.xml is the CA1 cell morphology with channels from the cerebellar granule cell!
It shows spikes that are a few tens of microsecond wide using 10microsec time step in ee,
 but hsolve just oscillates for 10microsec, with 1 microsec time step, hsolve works.

CA1.morph.xml is the original file from neuroConstruct, but the inhomogeneous_value tags have been removed,
 and hd channels with negative conductances have been removed,
 and some new channels with the parameter changes hard coded have been used.
This works in MOOSE, but fires uniformly spontaneously at a low rate.
