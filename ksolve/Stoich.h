#ifndef _STOICH_H

/**
 * Stoich is the class that handles the stoichiometry matrix for a
 * reaction system, and also setting up the computations for reaction
 * rates. It has to coordinate the operation of a number of model
 * definition classes, most importantly: Pools, Reacs and Enz(yme)s.
 * It also coordinates the setup of a large number of numerical solution
 * engines, or solvers: Ksolve, Gsolve, Dsolve, and SteadyState.
 * The setup process has to follow a tight order, most of which is
 * internally manged by the Stoich.
 * The Stoich itself does not do any 'process' functions. It just sets up
 * data structures for the other objects that do the crunching.
 *
 * 1. Compartment is set up to a cell (neuroMesh) or volume (other meshes)
 * 2. Compartment assigned to Stoich. Here it assigns unique vols.
 * 3. Dsolve and Ksolve assigned to Stoich using setKsolve and setDsolve.
 * 	 3.1 At this point the Stoich::useOneWay_ flag is set if it is a Gsolve.
 * 4. Call Stoich::setPath. All the rest happens internally, done by Stoich:
 * 		4.1 assign compartment to Dsolve and Ksolve.
 * 		4.2 assign numPools and compts to Dsolve and Ksolve.
 * 		4.3 During Zombification, zeroth vector< RateTerm* > is built.
 * 		4.4 afterZombification, stoich builds rateTerm vector for all vols.
 * 		4.5 Stoich assigns itself to Dsolve and Ksolve.
 * 			- Ksolve sets up volIndex on each VoxelPool
 * 			- Dsolve gets vector of pools, extracts DiffConst and MotorConst
 * 		4.6 Dsolve assigned to Ksolve::dsolve_ field by the Stoich.
 * 	5. Reinit,
 * 		5.1 Dsolve builds matrix, provided dt has changed. It needs dt.
 * 		5.2 Ksolve builds solvers if not done already, assigning initDt
 *
 * As seen by the user, this reduces to just 4 stages:
 * - Make the objects.
 * - Assign compartment, Ksolve and Dsolve to stoich.
 * - Set the stoich path.
 * - Reinit.
