This is the directory for the NeuroML files generated by neuroConstruct 1.5.1 (neuroConstruct.org) for the Cerebellar Granule cell model
(Maex, R and De Schutter, E. Synchronization of Golgi and Granule Cell Firing in a Detailed Network Model of the Cerebellar Granule Cell Layer, J Neurophysiol, Nov 1998; 80: 2521 - 2537).
These files were exported from neuroConstruct as Level 3 NeuroML v 1.x files (not a single NeuroML Level 3 file).
However, further NeuroML channels have been added to the single compartment, so that their effect can be studied.

Fire up moose GUI. File->Load Model or Ctrl+L. Navigate to this directory.
Select and open the allChannelsCell.net.xml file.
Select the soma (graphical viewer or element tree) and click 'add field' on the right 'plot configuration' pane to plot Vm.
Run the simulation and see the soma Vm.

Select channels from the element tree and change Gmax to observe different behaviours. Setting Gmax to zero is equivalent to removing the channel.
