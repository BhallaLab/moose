This is the MOOSE documentation directory. The documentation is grouped into
the following directories:

    - user: This is for anyone wishing to learn/use MOOSE.
            This part of the documentation is encoded in Markdown format.
    - developer: If you wish to learn about MOOSE code, go here.
    - doxygen: Source code documentation generation.
    - markdown: This contains a quick introduction to Markdown itself.
    - images: These are images that are included in the user and developer
              documentation.

N.B.: This text file has Windows-style line endings (CR/LF) for easy
viewing in Windows. We will try to keep the other text files here
Windows-compatible (e.g.: *.markdown files), but we may slip.
If you have difficulty viewing them in Notepad, try the inbuilt Wordpad
editor, or better still, download a good text editor like Notepad++ or Geany.
