MOOSE Cookbook   
==============

The MOOSE Cookbook contains recipes showing you how to do specific
tasks in MOOSE.

Loading and running models
--------------------------
This section of the documentation explains how to load and run predefined
models in MOOSE.

The Hodgkin-Huxley demo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is a self-contained graphical demo implemented by Subhasis Ray,
closely based on the 'Squid' demo by Mark Nelson which ran in GENESIS.

   showing action potentials generated by a step current injection.
      

The demo has built-in documentation and may be run from the
``moose-examples/squid`` subdirectory of MOOSE. If you want to read a simpler
implementation of the same (without the code for setting up GUI),
check out :ref:`hhmodel`.

Computing arbitrary functions on the fly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sometimes you want to calculate arbitrary function of the state
variables of one or more elements and feed the result into another
element during a simulation. The Function class is useful for this.

.. automodule:: function
   :members:

Solving arbitrary differential equations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Function classes are also useful for setting up arbitrary differential
equations. MOOSE supports solution of such equation systems, with the
caveat that it thinks they should be chemical systems and therefore 
interprets the variables as concentrations. MOOSE does not permit the 
concentrations to go negative.

.. automodule:: diffEqSolution
    :members:

This limitation on positive solutions can be overcome with offsets to the
variables. 

.. automodule:: funcRateHarmonicOsc
    :members:

It is also possible to set up other forms of differential equations,
where instead of directly controlling the rate of change of a pool, the
equations take the form of modifying the rate of a reaction involving 
a pool.

.. automodule:: funcReacLotkaVolterra
    :members:

The solutions of such systems are much more accurate and faster using the
chemical kinetic solver than with the basic exponential Euler method. 
However, it is important to point out that the use of arbitrary 
differential equations to represent chemical systems is
discouraged in MOOSE. This is for the simple reason that they are 
abstractions, frequently with serious flaws, of the underlying chemistry.
At the current time the stochastic solver cannot handle systems formulated
with functions rather than chemical objects.

Chemical Signaling models

This section of the documentation explains how to do operations specific
to the chemical signaling.

Building a chemical model from parts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Disclaimer: Avoid doing this for all but the very simplest models. This
is error-prone, tedious, and non-portable. For preference use one of the
standard model formats like SBML, which MOOSE and many other tools can
read and write.

Nevertheless, it is useful to see how these models are set up. 
There are several tutorials and snippets that build the entire chemical
model system using the basic MOOSE calls. The sequence of steps is
typically:

    #. Create container (chemical compartment) for model. This is typically
       a CubeMesh, a CylMesh, and if you really know what you are doing,
       a NeuroMesh.
    #. Create the reaction components: pools of molecules **moose.Pool**;
       reactions **moose.Reac**; and enzymes **moose.Enz**. Note that when
       creating an enzyme, one must also create a molecule beneath it to
       serve as the enzyme-substrate complex.  Other less-used
       components include Michaelis-Menten enzymes **moose.MMenz**, input
       tables, pulse generators and so on. These are illustrated in other
       examples. All these reaction components should be child objects
       of the compartment, since this defines what volume they will occupy. 
       Specifically , a pool or reaction object must be placed somewhere 
       below the compartment in the object tree for the volume to be 
       set correctly and for the solvers to know what to use.
    #. Assign parameters for the components. 

        * Compartments have a **volume**, and each subtype will have 
          quite elaborate options for partitioning the compartment 
          into voxels.
        * **Pool** s have one key parameter, the initial 
          concentration **concInit**.
        * **Reac** tions have two parameters: **Kf** and **Kb**. 
        * **Enz** ymes have two primary parameters **kcat** and **Km**. 
          That is enough for **MMenz** ymes. Regular **Enz** ymes have
          an additional parameter **k2** which by default is set to 4.0
          times **kcat**, but you may also wish to explicitly assign it
          if you know its value.

    #. Connect up the reaction system using moose messaging.
    #. Create and connect up input and output tables as needed.
    #. Create and connect up the solvers as needed. This has to be done
       in a specific order. Examples are linked below, but briefly the
       order is:
       
       a. Make the compartment and reaction system.
       b. Make the Ksolve or Gsolve.
       c. Make the Stoich.
       d. Assign **stoich.compartment** to the compartment
       e. Assign **stoich.ksolve** to either the Ksolve or Gsolve.
       f. Assign **stoich.path** to finally fill in the reaction system.

       There is an additional step if diffusion is also present, see
       `Reaction-diffusion in a cylinder`_.

Some examples of doing this are in:

    * `Making a dose-response curve`_ , which defines a small bistable
      system including three **Pool** s, two **Enz** ymes and a 
      **Reac** tion.
    * `Feeding tabulated input to a model`_, which shows how to connect up
      a **StimulusTable** object to a simple 2-molecule reaction.
    * `Reaction-diffusion in a cylinder`_, which defines a simple binding
      reaction and embeds it in a 1-dimensional diffusive volume of 
      a cylinder.

The recommended way to build a chemical model, of course, is to load it
in from a file format specific to such models. MOOSE understands
**SBML**, **kkit.g** (a legacy GENESIS format), and **cspace** 
(a very compact format used in a large study of bistables from
Ramakrishnan and Bhalla, PLoS Comp. Biol 2008).

One key concept is that in MOOSE the components, messaging, and access
to model components is identical regardless of whether the model was
built from parts, or loaded in from a file. All that the file loaders do
is to use the file to automate the steps above. Thus the model components
and their fields are completely accessible from the script even if
the model has been loaded from a file. See 
`Accessing and tweaking parameters`_ for an example of this.


Oscillation models

Bistability models

1. MAPK feedback loop model.

.. automodule:: mapkFB

Reaction-diffusion models
-------------------------
The MOOSE design for reaction-diffusion is to specify one or
more cellular 'compartments', and embed reaction systems in each of them.

A 'compartment', in the context of reaction-diffusion, is used in the 
cellular sense of a biochemically defined,
volume restricted subpart of a cell. Many but not all compartments
are bounded by a cell membrane, but biochemically the membrane itself
may form a compartment. Note that this interpretation differs from that
of a 'compartment' in detailed electrical models of neurons.

A reaction system can be loaded in from any of the supported MOOSE
formats, or built within Python from MOOSE parts.

The computations for such models are done by a set of objects: 
Stoich, Ksolve and Dsolve. Respectively, these handle the model 
reactions and stoichiometry matrix, the reaction computations for 
each voxel, and the diffusion between voxels. The 'Compartment' specifies
how the model should be spatially discretized.

Reaction-diffusion in neurons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Reaction-diffusion systems can easily be embedded into neuronal geometries.
MOOSE does so by treating each neuron as a pseudo 1-dimensional object. 
This means that diffusion only happens along the axis of dendritic 
segments, not radially from inside to outside a dendrite, nor tangentially 
around the dendrite circumference.
Here we illustrate two cases. The simple case treats the entire neuron 
as a single, chemically equivalent reaction-diffusion system in a binary
branching neuronal tree. The more complex example shows how to set up
three chemically distinct kinds of subdivisions within the neuron:
the dendritic tree, the dendritic spine heads, and the postsynaptic 
densities. In both examples we embed a simple Turing-like spatial oscillator
in every compartment of the model neurons, so as to see nice oscillations
and animations. The first example has a particularly striking pseudo-3D
rendition of the neuron and the molecular spatial oscillations within it.

Cross-compartment reaction systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Frequently reaction systems span cellular (chemical) compartments. 
For example, a membrane-bound molecule may be phosphorylated by a
cytosolic kinase, using soluble ATP as one of the substrates. Here the
membrane and the cytsol are different chemical compartments.
MOOSE supports such reactions. The following snippets illustrate
cross-compartment chemistry. Note that the interpretation of the rates
of enzymes and reactions does depend on which compartment they reside in.

Single neuron models
--------------------

Neurons are modelled as equivalent electrical circuits. The morphology
of a neuron can be broken into isopotential compartments connected by
axial resistances R\ :sub:`a`\  denoting the cytoplasmic
resistance. In each compartment, the neuronal membrane is represented as
a capacitance C\ :sub:`m`\  with a shunt leak resistance
R\ :sub:`m`\ . Electrochemical gradient (due to ion pumps)
across the leaky membrane causes a voltage drive E\ :sub:`m`\ ,
that hyperpolarizes the inside of the cell membrane compared to the
outside.

Each voltage dependent ion channel, present on the membrane, is modelled
as a voltage dependent conductance G\ :sub:`k`\  with gating
kinetics, in series with an electrochemical voltage drive (battery)
E\ :sub:`k`\ , across the membrane capacitance
C\ :sub:`m`\ , as in the figure below.

--------------

.. figure:: ../../images/neuroncompartment.png
   :align: center
   :alt: **Equivalent circuit of neuronal compartments**

   **Equivalent circuit of neuronal compartments**

--------------

Neurons fire action potentials / spikes (sharp rise and fall of membrane
potential V\ :sub:`m`\ ) due to voltage dependent channels.
These result in opening of excitatory / inhibitory synaptic channels
(conductances with batteries, similar to voltage gated channels) on
other connected neurons in the network.

MOOSE can handle large networks of detailed neurons, each with
complicated channel dynamics. Further, MOOSE can integrate chemical
signalling with electrical activity. Presently, creating and simulating
these requires PyMOOSE scripting, but these will be incorporated into
the GUI in the future.

To understand channel kinetics and neuronal action potentials, run the
Squid Axon demo installed along with MOOSEGUI and consult its
help/tutorial.

Read more about compartmental modelling in the first few chapters of the
`Book of
Genesis <http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/iBoG/iBoGpdf/index.html>`_.

Models can be defined in `NeuroML <http://www.neuroml.org>`_, an XML
format which is mostly supported across simulators. Channels, neuronal
morphology (compartments), and networks can be specified using various
levels of NeuroML, namely ChannelML, MorphML and NetworkML. Importing of
cell models in the `GENESIS <http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS>`_
.p format is supported for backwards compatibitility.

Modeling details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some salient properties of neuronal building blocks in MOOSE are
described below. Variables that are updated at every simulation time
step are are listed **dynamical**. Rest are parameters.

-  **Compartment**
   When you select a compartment, you can view and edit its properties
   in the right pane. V\ :sub:`m`\  and I\ :sub:`m`\ 
   are plot-able.

   -  V\ :sub:`m`\ 
        membrane potential (across C\ :sub:`m`\ ) in Volts. It is a 
        dynamical variable.
   -  C\ :sub:`m`\ 
        membrane capacitance in Farads.
   -  E\ :sub:`m`\ 
        membrane leak potential in Volts due
        to the electrochemical gradient setup by ion pumps.
   -  I\ :sub:`m`\ 
        current in Amperes across the membrane via leak resistance R\ 
        :sub:`m`\ .
   -  inject
        current in Amperes injected externally into the compartment.
   -  initVm
        initial V\ :sub:`m`\  in Volts.
   -  R\ :sub:`m`\ 
        membrane leak resistance in Ohms due to leaky channels.
   -  diameter
        diameter of the compartment in metres.
   -  length
        length of the compartment in metres.

-  **HHChannel**
    Hodgkin-Huxley channel with voltage dependent dynamical gates.

   -  Gbar
        peak channel conductance in Siemens.
   -  E\ :sub:`k`\ 
        reversal potential of the channel, due to electrochemical 
        gradient of the ion(s) it allows.
   -  G\ :sub:`k`\ 
        conductance of the channel in Siemens.
        G\ :sub:`k`\ (t) = Gbar × X(t)\ :sup:`Xpower`\  ×
        Y(t)\ :sup:`Ypower`\  × Z(t)\ :sup:`Zpower`\ 

   -  I\ :sub:`k`\ 
        current through the channel into the neuron in Amperes.
          I\ :sub:`k`\ (t) = G\ :sub:`k`\ (t) ×
          (E\ :sub:`k`\ -V\ :sub:`m`\ (t))

   -  X, Y, Z
        gating variables (range 0.0 to 1.0) that may turn on or off as 
        voltage increases with different time constants.

          dX(t)/dt = X\ :sub:`inf`\ /τ - X(t)/τ

          Here, X\ :sub:`inf`\  and τ are typically
          sigmoidal/linear/linear-sigmoidal functions of membrane 
          potential V\ :sub:`m`\ , which are described in a ChannelML 
          file and presently not editable from MOOSEGUI. Thus, a gate 
          may open (X\ :sub:`inf`\ (V\ :sub:`m`\ ) → 1) or close (X\ 
          :sub:`inf`\ (V\ :sub:`m`\ ) → 0) on increasing V\ :sub:`m`\ 
          , with time constant τ(V\ :sub:`m`\ ).

   -  Xpower, Ypower, Zpower
        powers to which gates are raised in the G\ :sub:`k`\ (t) 
        formula above.

-  **HHChannel2D**
   The Hodgkin-Huxley channel2D can have the usual voltage dependent
   dynamical gates, and also gates that depend on voltage and an
   ionic concentration, as for say Ca-dependent K conductance. It has
   the properties of HHChannel above, and a few more, similar to
   in the `GENESIS tab2Dchannel
   reference <http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/Hyperdoc/Manual-26.html#ss26.61>`_.

-  **CaConc**
   This is a pool of Ca ions in each compartment, in a shell volume
   under the cell membrane. The dynamical Ca concentration increases
   when Ca channels open, and decays back to resting with a specified
   time constant τ. Its concentration controls Ca-dependent K channels,
   etc.

   -  Ca
        Ca concentration in the pool in units mM ( i.e., mol/m\ 
        :sup:`3`\ ).

          d[Ca\ :sup:`2+`\ ]/dt = B × I\ :sub:`Ca`\  -
          [Ca\ :sup:`2+`\ ]/τ

   -  CaBasal/Ca_base
        Base Ca concentration to which the Ca decays
   -  tau
        time constant with which the Ca concentration decays to the base Ca level.
   -  B
        constant in the [Ca\ :sup:`2+`\ ] equation above.
   -  thick
        thickness of the Ca shell within the cell membrane which is 
        used to calculate B (see Chapter 19 of `Book of GENESIS 
        <http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/iBoG/iBoGpdf/index.html>`_.)

Neuronal simulations in MOOSEGUI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Neuronal models in various formats can be loaded and simulated in the
**MOOSE Graphical User Interface**. The GUI displays the neurons in 3D,
and allows visual selection and editing of neuronal properties. Plotting
and visualization of activity proceeds concurrently with the simulation.
Support for creating and editing channels, morphology and networks is
planned for the future. MOOSEGUI uses SI units throughout.

   to read in a NeuroML model and to set up simulations. There are ample
   snippets in ~/moose/moose-examples/snippets too.
