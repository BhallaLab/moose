This is a modified version of contents of directory
../../../Demos/neuroml/CA1PyramidalCell/ . This is here for purpose of testing
only.

File ./ca1_test.py adds two tests: injected current vs frequency and no of spike
when a certain amount of current is inject. If these test fails, neuroml parser
is not working properly.
