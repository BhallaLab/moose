Visit `this page
<https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:moose&package=moose>`_
to pick your distribution and follow instructions.

.. note::
    ``moogli`` (tool to visualize network activity) is not available for CentOS-6.

.. todo:: Packages for gentoo, Arch Linux

Mac OSX
^^^^^^^

Download the ``dmg`` file from `here <https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose/releases/download/ghevar_3.0.2/Moose_3.0.2_OSX.dmg>`_.

Alternatively, you can use ``homebrew`` to install ``moose``
::
    $ brew install homebrew/science/moose


Windows/Cygwin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Building MOOSE
--------------

In case your distribution is not listed on `our repository page
<https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:moose&package=moose>`_
, or if you want to build the lastest development code, read on.

First, you need to get the source code. You can use ``git`` (clone the
repository) or download snapshot of github repo by clicking on `this link
<https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose/archive/master.zip>`_.::
    $ git clone https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose

Or,
::
    $ wget https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose/archive/master.zip
    $ unzip master.zip

If you don't want lasest snapshot of ``MOOSE``, you can download other released
versions from here `https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose/releases`.

Install dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, you need to install required dependencies. Depending on your OS, names of
following packages may vary.

- cmake (version 2.8 or higher)
- gsl-1.16 or higher `download <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/>`_.
- libhdf5 development package e.g. `libhdf5-serial-dev` or `libhdf5-devel`
- python development package e.g. `python-dev` or `python-devel`
- numpy e.g. `python-numpy` or `numpy`

Most of the dependencies can be installed using package manager.

On ``Debian/Ubuntu``
::
    $ sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev cmake libgsl0-dev libpython-dev python-numpy

.. note::
    Ubuntu 12.04 does not have required version of ``gsl`` (required 1.16 or
    higher, available 1.15). On Ubuntu 16.04, package name is ``libgsl-dev``.

On ``CentOS/Fedora/RHEL/Scientific Linux``
::
    $ sudo yum install hdf5-devel cmake libgsl-dev python-devel python-numpy

On ``OpenSUSE``
::
    $ sudo zypper install hdf5-devel cmake libgsl-dev python-devel python-numpy

Now use `cmake` to build moose
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd /to/moose/source/code
   $ mkdir _build
   $ cd _build
   $ cmake  ..
   $ make
   $ ctest --output-on-failure  # optional

This will build pyMOOSE (MOOSE's python extention), `ctest` will run few tests to
check if build process was successful.

.. note::
    To install MOOSE into non-standard directory, pass additional argument
    `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path/to/install/dir` to cmake
    ::
        $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIC=$HOME/.local ..

    To use different version of python
    ::
        $ cmake -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/opt/python3/bin/python3 ..

After that installation is pretty easy
::
    $ sudo make install

If everything went fine, you should be able to import moose in python shell.

.. code-block:: python

    import moose


Graphical User Interface (GUI)
------------------------------

You can get the source of ``moose-gui`` from `here
<https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose-gui>`_. You can download it either by
clicking on `this link <https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose-gui/archive/master.zip>`_
or by using ``git`` ::
    $ git clone https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose-gui

To be able to launch ``moose-gui``, you need to install some more packages

- matplotlib
- python-qt4

On ``Ubuntu/Debian``, these can be installed with
::
    $ sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib python-qt4

On ``CentOS/Fedora/RHEL``
::
    $ sudo yum install python-matplotlib python-qt4

Now you can fire up the GUI
::
    $ cd /to/moose-gui
    $ python mgui.py

.. note::
    If you have installed ``moose`` package, then GUI is launched by
    running following commnad::
        $ moose

Building moogli
---------------

``moogli`` is subproject of ``MOOSE`` for visualizing models. More details can
be found `here <http://moose.ncbs.res.in/moogli>`_.

`Moogli` is part of `moose` package. Building moogli can be tricky because of
multiple depednecies it has.


To get the latest source code of ``moogli``, click on `this link <https://github.com/BhallaLab/moogli/archive/master.zip>`_.

Moogli depends on ``OpenSceneGraph`` (version 3.2.0 or higher) which may not
be easily available for your operating system.
For this reason, we distribute required ``OpenSceneGraph`` with ``moogli``
source code.

Depending on distribution of your operating system, you would need following
packages to be installed.

On ``Ubuntu/Debian``
::
    $ sudo apt-get install python-qt4-dev python-qt4-gl python-sip-dev libqt4-dev

On ``Fedora/CentOS/RHEL``
::
    $ sudo yum install sip-devel PyQt4-devel qt4-devel libjpeg-devel PyQt4

On ``openSUSE``
::
    $ sudo zypper install python-sip python-qt4-devel libqt4-devel python-qt4

After this, building and installing ``moogli`` should be as simple as
::
    $ cd /path/to/moogli
    $ mkdir _build
    $ cd _build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

If you run into troubles, please report it on our `github repository
<https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose/issues>`_.
